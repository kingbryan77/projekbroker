  "description": "A frontend simulation of a professional broker trading platform, featuring a login/registration system and a member dashboard with deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history. All backend functionalities like user authentication, transaction processing, and data persistence are simulated client-side using local storage for demonstration purposes. This application requires a robust backend for production use, which is beyond the scope of this frontend-only implementation.",
